# GCC - Gothic Character Creator
GCC is tool designed to make process of making head/body textures easier for everyone for your upcoming Gothic Projects.
Currently tool is really rough, but I working on every possible improvement that come to my mind.

# Current Features :
1. Loading custom assets made by you.
2. Every single asset have 2 free channels for you custom channel coloring needs. (Red is mainly for skin, but not always, hair is exception.)
3. Baking is functional, you can output your mixed textures into .png file. (Currently I dont really know how could I make TGA export.)
4. Good and as most as possible accurate preview of character with ability to select different head model.

# Planned Features :
1. Smaller/Positional assets :
    - Currently assets use standard size format of head/body texture, and need to be correctly placed, so they are static.
    - This feature will also improve customization, you will be able to set height of eyes/mouth and even separation and rotation.
2. Support for custom models :
    - I working on ASC importer, but it have some problems, so its not implemented yet.
3. Nothing more come to my mind!
